                <p>This is a sample blog for INFO2180 lab2; Each blog post should contain at least two paragraphs and should have an image floated either to the left or the
                  right with the paragraphs wrapping around it. You may need to make your paragraphs a bit longer in order to
                  properly see the effect of the text wrapping around the image. Also
                  dont make your images too big. You can set the height and width
                  attributes on the image tag to make them smaller. 
                  A blog is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries. 
                  Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page.
                  In recent times, bloggers have become famous for various reasons. Blogging has become an alternative career or side gig for many.</p>
